This is the example project that we have been working on

Goal of the Project:
- Stars should have randomized sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
- Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
- Each star should have a unique ID
- The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analyzed by other programs
